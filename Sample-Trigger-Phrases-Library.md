## 📊 Trigger Phrase Best Practices

### Do's
✅ **Include variations**: People ask the same question many ways
✅ **Use natural language**: How people actually talk, not formal language
✅ **Add common misspellings**: Users make typos
✅ **Include acronyms**: LMS, PTO, OOO, etc.
✅ **Use question formats**: "How do I...", "What is...", "Where can I..."
✅ **Add urgency phrases**: "urgent", "asap", "now", "immediately"
✅ **Include role-specific terms**: Job titles, departments, levels

### Don'ts
❌ **Too specific**: Trigger phrases should be broad enough
❌ **Overlapping phrases**: Don't use same phrase in multiple topics
❌ **Too technical**: Include plain language versions
❌ **Only formal language**: Include casual variations
❌ **Ignore synonyms**: "help", "support", "assistance" all mean the same

### Testing Your Trigger Phrases
1. Ask colleagues how they would ask the question
2. Review chatbot analytics for unrecognized phrases
3. Monitor support ticket language
